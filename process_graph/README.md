## To compile the program to procss graphs
```bash
make 
```

## Copy the results from the first step.
```bash
./copy.sh 
```
to copy over the cfg.dot from parse_program/

## Run the code to generate probabilities for HMM:
```bash
./parseGRAPH > report.txt
```

## Test
Test folder includes a sample output for cfg.dot in the original folder. 

The initialized transitive probability matrix (transi-prob)
 and statistic information
