# Context-Sensitive HMM


Cover utility applications and server programs:

- all_functions, transi_prob, uncalled are generated by c++ code and copied over here.
- initial: the aggregated call transition matrices
- initial all: final call transition matrices used later for initializing HMM
model: output trained model
