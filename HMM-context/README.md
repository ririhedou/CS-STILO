# HMM with context-sensitive traces

The training and testing covers utility applications and server programs:

## Programs
Under each program (e.g., grep_v5):

- strace-sensitive includes pre-processed traces with 1-level calling context 
- all_functions, transi_prob, uncalled are generated by step 1&2 and copied over here.
- initial: the aggregated call transition matrice
- intial all: final call transition matrices used later for initializing HMM
- results/model: output trained model
- lib includes the dependence libraries 
- src contains the java code for training and testing HMM

## Preprocess traces

under folder preprocess

- K-means clustering
- Principal component analysis (PCA)
