# Context-Sensitive HMM

The training and testing covers utility applications and server programs:

Under each program (e.g., grep_v5):

- all_functions, transi_prob, uncalled are generated by step 1&2 and copied over here.
- initial: the aggregated call transition matrice
- intial all: final call transition matrices used later for initializing HMM
- results/model: output trained model
